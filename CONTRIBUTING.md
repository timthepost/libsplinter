Contributions of any kind are welcome provided that:

 - You add tests if new tests are needed,
 - All existing / applicable tests pass
 - Unit tests run Valgrind clean
 - If more than trivial, you're willing to help maintain

Please review the code of conduct located at the root of 
this repository before sending pull requests.

If your contribution is less than trivial and *isn't* part
of the current development focus, it might be a good idea to
open an issue to discuss the PR first.

"Oddball" ideas are welcome!
