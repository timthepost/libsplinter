# shmbus - Original Ancestor Of Libsplinter

_Forked off of initial implementation 7/15/2025 to serve as a reference copy.
Included in hopes it's useful._

Shmbus is very similar to splinter; in fact, splinter started out as shmbus
and then forked off to better cater to the needs of a runtime. 

Shmbus also has the most basic version of the envelope protocol that was
developed, which allows one to transplant the core functionality without having 
to separate it from all of the later implementation details.

It's here as a building block for any future uses it might have, without a lot
of evolution in other directions to strip away before it can be included.

Use it any way it is useful, hopefully in good health; if not, hopefully at
least in good spirits!
