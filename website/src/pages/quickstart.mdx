Here's how to get up and running quickly!

## Local Configuration

Make sure you modify the `_config.ts` file and define the `location`
option, so that things work correctly. Here's what it looks like 
after being set to `example.com`:

```ts

// after imports 

const site = lume({
  src: "./src",
  location: new URL('https://example.com'),
  server: {
    middlewares: [
      router.middleware(),
      cacheBusting(),
    ],
  },
});

site.use(plugins());

export default site;
```

You should also check the `_data.yml` files in `docs/`, `blog/` and `pages`, as well
as the site strings in `src/_data/*.yml`. This includes the tag wiki excerpts, locale 
strings as well as home page content.

## Deploy On Deno Deploy (Supported)

If you have not yet done so, [sign up for Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). It's 
completely free, and currently the only way you can use the included
anonymous content feedback & rating system. For now, if you want to use the
theme, it's your best bet.

### Create And Save An Access Token To .env-local

You'll need an access token in order to be able to connect to DenoKV locally, 
when running under `lume -s`. If you don't plan to do that (you won't be using
the feedback plugin) then you can skip this part.

Save your access token as `DENO_KV_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your `.env-local` file.

### Copy And Save The Database Connection String To .env-local

Navigate to the KV tab in your Deno Deploy dashboard. You'll see your database
information there along with information on how to connect. 

On Deno Deploy, no arguments are necessary. However, locally, you need to
specify the URL. Copy the URL part of the connection string 
(minus the `await Deno.kvOpen()`). It should look something like:

```url
# sample only, get the real one from Deno Deploy KV tab
https://api.deno.com/databases/UUID-of-database/connect
```

Save your connection URL as `DENO_KV_URL` in your `.env-local`

On production, there's nothing to configure. Locally, just make sure you load
your `.env-local` file before running `deno task dev` or `deno task serve` and 
you'll be fine. 

## Deploy On Deno VPS (Supported)

Follow the same instructions as Deno Deploy (above) if you want to use the 
database. You can use the Deno Deploy URL as a free dev tier if you want.

You'll need the following (minimum) to start the server:

```bash
> deno run --allow-read --allow-env --allow-net src/_serve.ts
```

Assuming you run this from the repository root, where `deno.json` can be 
found. Otherwise, you'll have to also enable Deno's unstable flags (using
[whichever of these methods suits you best](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/unstable_flags/))
in order to enable support for the temporal API and Deno KV (as shown in 
`deno.json`):

```json
  "unstable": [
    "kv",
    "temporal"
  ]
```

Or, set the repo root as your working directory prior to serving (preferred),
which automatically loads `deno.json` and turns them on.

## Deploy On Host With Deno Edge Functions (Possible, But Currently Unsupported)

Netlify edge functions are _technically_ capable of running Lume's Router
middleware, but you'll have to figure out how to move `src/_serve.ts` and
`src/_server_routes.ts` into an edge function that remains responsive for
requests. And, you'll need to upgrade to paid, since you'll have to set 
environmental variables for Deno (or even Discord, Slack or whatever else
you used) even if DenoKV wasn't used.

If you can think of a stable way to make things work there, I'd love to 
hear about your setup and try to support it better on my side. I just think
it's a bigger lift than what Netlify meant for edge functions.
