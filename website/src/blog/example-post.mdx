Whether you chose it because it's based on [Infima](https://infima.dev), or 
because of the pre-configured features, or any combination of reasons, ***we're
glad you're here building websites with us using it!*** There are lots of options out 
there which makes picking a theme for a new project very time-consuming, so we'll 
be brief and help you make the best use of your time. First, you are cordially invited 
to come hang out with us in our relaxed and low-traffic Discord; we're very welcoming, 
trade ideas and help each other all the time!

It's not absolutely necessary, of course, but it's the primary means of support 
for the theme.

## The Cushy Text Discord Server:

If you have a question about _this_ theme, or an idea for how to make it
even better, come join the [Cushy Text Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH). It's 
very low-volume and exists only so conversation about the theme doesn't become a distraction 
for the main Lume Discord server.

Again, if your question is about:

 - Cushy Text (This Theme)
 - The SEO Plugin
 - The Table Of Contents (TOC) Plugin
 - Infima-related

... it's a great fit for the small Cushy Text Discord! That's not to say that 
these boundaries are absolute and it must be one bucket or the other. The author
of the theme along with most people beta testing all or some of it are also in 
the Lume server. We just don't want to keep lighting up people's phones with chatter 
that isn't relevant to them. Use your best judgement and please be patient if asked 
to move a conversation or question to one or the other servers.

## Lume's Discord Server:

Lume's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YbTmpACHWB) is very low-volume and extremely 
helpful; bugs are  often fixed on-the-spot and there's a very short time to getting answers 
to questions there.

If your question is more _about Lume_ than it is _about the theme_ (e.g. it could apply
no matter what theme you were using), then you should bring it to the Lume server instead
in order to get a fast and accurate answer.

## Thanks Again!

Time is really valuable! You spent some of yours trying this theme, and it's appreciated. 

We hope to see you in Discord!
