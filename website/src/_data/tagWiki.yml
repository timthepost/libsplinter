announcements:
  summary: >
    The announcements tag is applied when there's a major announcement
    to make, such as a new release or other major news about the project.


    It's not used very often, so if you subscribe to a feed and see
    the tag, it's probably worth checking out.

  summary: >
    The `updates` tag is similar to the `announcements` tag in that it
    is accompanied by news about Cushy Text, however it's used much more
    frequently than announcements.


    Part of the process of building Cushy Text has also been learning a
    lot about Lume, and I like to do my learning "out loud", so frequent
    updates are planned along with tutorials when I figure out things
    worth sharing.
