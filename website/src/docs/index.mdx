# {title}

Run through the [quick start](/quickstart/), then [see the docs](https://cushytext.deno.dev/docs/)
to check out all the cool stuff you can do.

Near-term development goals are listed below, so you know what's on the horizon as 
you experience the theme. Any feedback or ideas are appreciated in our 
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH).

Here's what's on the horizon (to keep in mind, as you explore this initial release). 
Thanks for giving the theme a try!

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.5`)</h2>
 - More robust archetype scripts and CMS integration.
 - Docs supports sub-folders, but only one level deep. Needs a sidebar format so 
   larger installs can bypass auto-nav and hand it an object instead.
 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.
 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.
 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.
 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)
