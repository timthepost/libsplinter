## Sub-Folders In Docs Are Supported 1-Level Deep

Index files in sub-folders set the name of the category. If there's 
no index with a `title`, the folder / directory name is used instead. Notice 
this file has an order of 15 from its frontmatter:

```yml
title: Example Folder Category
menu:
  visible: true
  order: 15
```

This pins it to the bottom, unless something else is added with 
a value _greater_ than 15. The nav is built based on `menu.order`
_ascending_. Additional pages in sub-section / categories should have a value of
 _at least_ the same as the parent index page in order for the progress (next / prev) nav
paths to work. 

Feel free to delete this folder; it's just here to show you how sub-folders work in 
docs.
