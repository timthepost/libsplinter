# Security Policy

Splinter is currently in a very _alpha quality_ state, and while actively
maintained, isn't yet ready for production use. 

The _current_ version of the library as defined in `config.h` is always
supported, as well as the development branch `splinter-devel`.

## Supported Versions

The following versions are supported:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.4   | :white_check_mark: |
| next    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.5.3 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you need to report a vulnerability, it's best to file an issue at Github. 

If you need to report it privately, contact me at `timthepost@protonmail.com`.

I usually get back to people within 24 - 36 hours.
