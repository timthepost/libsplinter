v0.5.2 "Test ... ALL THE THINGS!"
 - Now have unit tests for bindings/ts/splinter.class.ts!!
 - Additional documentation updates, tweaks and fixes
 - MRSW stress test harness now outputs progress (--quiet suppresses it)
 - MRSW stress test harness now creates unique store based on PID, and 
   garbage collects it (--keep-test-store to preserve it).
 - Make create/open behavior across tools symmetrical 
 - Valgrind inclusion is off by default (so it's not a build dependency)
   You can still use Valgrind to run the tests; this just affects the tighter
   integration.

v0.5.1 "Take Zero Dot Five One"
 - Maintenance / Cooling Release
 - New CHANGELOG
 - Dropped `splinter_logtee` from the build as `splinter_recv` now duplicates it.
 - Fixed dependency checks for `make install`
 - Updated documentation
 - Dropped Doxyfile (not needed, if someone else wants to maintain, it can be restored)
 - Updated TS Bindings & Splinter Class To Match Current Public C API
 - Created ffi_types.ts definition for TS bindings (for header / slot snapshots)
 - Dropped 'base protocol' definition since it was being mistaken for mandatory and not broadly   
   useful.
