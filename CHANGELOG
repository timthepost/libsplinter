v0.5.1 "Take Zero Dot Five One"
 - Maintenance / Cooling Release
 - New CHANGELOG
 - Dropped `splinter_logtee` from the build as `splinter_recv` now duplicates it.
 - Fixed dependency checks for `make install`
 - Updated documentation
 - Dropped Doxyfile (not needed, if someone else wants to maintain, it can be restored)
 - Updated TS Bindings & Splinter Class To Match Current Public C API
 - Created ffi_types.ts definition for TS bindings (for header / slot snapshots)
 - Dropped 'base protocol' definition since it was being mistaken for mandatory and not broadly useful.
