v0.9.0 "Almost There!" (Unreleased - Next Sprint)
 - Introduce `splinter_watch_dispatch()`, `splinter_watch_add()`, 
   `splinter_watch_eject()` and supporting allocating functions to watch 
   multiple keys mapped to callbacks (use `epoll()` in the client
   under the hood). *
 - Allow `oneshot` operation for the `watch` command so it can exit
   after one update, allowing  the client to re-establish if it wishes. *
 - MRSW Harness should report failure percentage and grade meaningfully
   in addition to raw numbers (0.000nnnnn% is the space we want to be for
   integrity failures by operation count for A+, 0.00n for B-, quickly fail
   at or past 0.01) (with auto vacuum off) *
 - Add `export` command to dump a store to a file in JSON/YAML format with
   grawk-assisted optional filtering. Not sure if I want this as part
   of the core or not. Thinking not, it'll be done all in the CLI. *
 - Implement reserved and user defined feature flags (as planned in docs/). * 

v0.5.5 "Periodic Maintenance Release"
 - Main entry point now understands persistent invocation (splinterpctl,
   splinterp_cli).
 - cli no longer pads length and keyval with spaces between colon 
   (3 : Fun -> 3:Fun)
 - The `config` command now sets auto_vacuum (config av (1/0)).
 - Fixed bug that caused mrsw stress test results to not unlink 
   automatically (persistent)
 - Now warn that MRSW torture tests can wear older media prematurely.
 - Significantly improved MRSW stress test harness for persistent
   use (now has a persistent config) and way better output.
 - Fixed command listing display in 'history' output for non-REPL mode
   (nn  : result -> nn: result)
 - Revamped main readme to include quick starts for code / CLI.

v0.5.4 "Persistence Pays Off"
 - Persistent mode is now a first-class feature / citizen. All binary
   targets now have tested persistent counterparts. The stress tool
   is a little too harsh by default for file-backed stores, suggest
   fewer threads (perhaps 4) and longer writer-us (1000) values.
 - Miscellaneous minor improvements

v0.5.3 "One tool to rule them all"
 - Clarified README claim about torn reads (used actual test numbers) and 
   explained the significance of Splinter's magic number selection.
 - Created 'init' command that allows creating stores with default
   or custom geometry.
 - Removed remaining individual tools: splinter_recv, splinter_send in 
   favor of now maintaining the CLI.
 - Normalized *not* silently creating databases prior to write calls
   (if missing) now that "init" exists.
 - splinter_create no longer creates zero-slot databases (sets errno)

v0.5.2 "Test ... ALL THE THINGS!"
 - Now have unit tests for bindings/ts/splinter.class.ts! While not yet
   at 100% coverage, `splinter.class.ts` is pretty well-tested. Run 
   `deno --allow-ffi test splinter.class_tests.ts` to see / use.
 - Additional documentation updates, tweaks and fixes
 - MRSW stress test harness now outputs progress (`--quiet` suppresses it)
 - MRSW stress test harness now creates unique store based on PID, and 
   garbage collects it (`--keep-test-store` preserves it).
 - Make create/open behavior across tools symmetrical 
 - Valgrind inclusion is off by default (so it's not a build dependency)
   You can still use Valgrind to run the tests; this just affects the tighter
   integration. Re-enable if you have `valgrind/valgrind.h (valgrind-devel)`.

v0.5.1 "Take Zero Dot Five One"
 - Maintenance / Cooling Release
 - New CHANGELOG
 - Dropped `splinter_logtee` from the build as `splinter_recv` now duplicates it.
 - Fixed dependency checks for `make install`
 - Updated documentation
 - Dropped Doxyfile (not needed, if someone else wants to maintain, it can be restored)
 - Updated TS Bindings & Splinter Class To Match Current Public C API
 - Created ffi_types.ts definition for TS bindings (for header / slot snapshots)
 - Dropped 'base protocol' definition since it was being mistaken for mandatory and not broadly   
   useful.

Sprints between minor versions usually last 1 - 3 weeks, depending.
