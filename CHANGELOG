v0.9.5 "The Web We Weave" (Unreleased: Next Next Next Next Sprint) June 2026
 - `serve` / `--serve` command that allows REST interaction with most CLI
   features for consuming and manipulating keys over HTTP(S).
 - Index directory page (Apache Style) that shows keys as links to values
   (requires some mime helpers)
 - Make MRSW test harness less cryptic about pass / fail metrics in results.
   Investigate write staggering -> torn read weird coupling (may be a short
   sighted writer design as it only happens with this harness).
 - Implement new Lume based website / documentation hub / blog & changelog
 - Implement GH discussions
 - Bugfix-only releases until 1.0.0 🎉 

v0.9.4 "Private Eyes 👏 (Duran Duran Tribute)" (Unreleased: Next Next Next Sprint) May 2026
 - Introduce `splinter_watch_dispatch(watch)`, `splinter_watch_add(array of keys)`, 
   `splinter_watch_eject(array of keys)` and supporting allocating functions to watch 
   multiple keys mapped to callbacks (use `epoll()` in the client
   under the hood)
 - Implement some kind of discrete watch cancellation plan (TBD)
 - Introduce `splinter_watch_add_tagged(array of tag strings)` to select swaths of keys 
   based on matching bloom filter
 - Implement cosine similarity filtering ***in CLI*** (as a demo of one way 
   to consume embeddings), maybe also populating a watch dispatch?
 - Implement embedding shard that updates / adds embeddings 
 - Implement policy eviction shard (that can optionally daemonize)
 - Implement LRU-policy eviction shard that implements its own storage to 
   track access time per key (will also daemonize)

v0.9.3 "Bits & Bolts" (Unreleased: Next Next Sprint) Feb / March 2026
 - Implement `set_with_embeddings`, `get_with_embeddings`, `get_embeddings`,
   `set_embeddings` and other API methods needed to manage embeddings. No
   indexing, just storage.
 - Implement INCR, DECR, AND, OR, NOT, XOR for named integer keys
   (in function form).
 - Implement conditional `set_if_(eq|lt|gt)`, `incr_if_(eq|lt|gt)`,
   `decr_if_(eq|lt|gt)` operations.
 - Implement the ability to populate a watch for dispatching based
   on bloom filter content.
 - Implement shard plumbing (TBD)
 
v0.9.2 "The Restructuring" (Unreleased: Next Sprint) Jan 2026
 - Implement 16 (8 reserved / 8 user defined) flags per slot
 - Implement `born` epoch per-slot (automatically the first epoch of the slot)
 - Implement 64 bit per-slot bloom filter for ctags style scoping
 - Implement vector storage backing + offset in slot header 
 - Implement reserved and user defined feature flags (as planned in docs/).
 - Implement atomic_uint_least64_t `ttl_ms` per-slot for expiry (doesn't
   implement eviction, it only declares a shelf life eviction can use in the
   absence of any other policy) (see also: `born`)
 - Implement minimal public-facing API changes required for the above to
   work (might not yet include actually storing embeddings).
 - Implement CLI changes necessary for new feature flag / slot layout
 - Implement ctags per-slot inside CLI

v0.9.1 "Bugfix Release" Jan 2026
 - Fix oversight in `init` that could lead to inadvertent writes to the wrong
   store, or cascading script failures.

v0.9.0 "Almost There!" Jan 2026
 - Allow `--oneshot` operation for the `watch` CLI command so it can exit
   after one update, allowing  the client to re-establish if it wishes.
 - Add `export` command to dump a store to a file in JSON format with
   grawk-assisted optional filtering as part of the CLI. This is the first
   step to early merge capabilities.
 - Implement `prefix` in the CLI to use simple namespace prefixes.
 - Obtain value of `prefix` setting from `SPLINTER_NS_PREFIX` environment 
   variable, if set (command line overrides it)
 - Set default store from `SPLINTER_DEFAULT_STORE` if not specified when
   starting the CLI. `use` will still work as usual, this just loads a
   default if not specified.
 - Last V1 bus architecture release (v2 starts on next sprint).

v0.5.5 "Periodic Maintenance Release"
 - Main entry point now understands persistent invocation (splinterpctl,
   splinterp_cli).
 - cli no longer pads length and keyval with spaces between colon 
   (3 : Fun -> 3:Fun)
 - The `config` command now sets auto_vacuum (config av (1/0)).
 - Fixed bug that caused mrsw stress test results to not unlink 
   automatically (persistent)
 - Now warn that MRSW torture tests can wear older media prematurely.
 - Significantly improved MRSW stress test harness for persistent
   use (now has a persistent config) and way better output.
 - Fixed command listing display in 'history' output for non-REPL mode
   (nn  : result -> nn: result)
 - Revamped main readme to include quick starts for code / CLI.

v0.5.4 "Persistence Pays Off"
 - Persistent mode is now a first-class feature / citizen. All binary
   targets now have tested persistent counterparts. The stress tool
   is a little too harsh by default for file-backed stores, suggest
   fewer threads (perhaps 4) and longer writer-us (1000) values.
 - Miscellaneous minor improvements

v0.5.3 "One tool to rule them all"
 - Clarified README claim about torn reads (used actual test numbers) and 
   explained the significance of Splinter's magic number selection.
 - Created 'init' command that allows creating stores with default
   or custom geometry.
 - Removed remaining individual tools: splinter_recv, splinter_send in 
   favor of now maintaining the CLI.
 - Normalized *not* silently creating databases prior to write calls
   (if missing) now that "init" exists.
 - splinter_create no longer creates zero-slot databases (sets errno)

v0.5.2 "Test ... ALL THE THINGS!"
 - Now have unit tests for bindings/ts/splinter.class.ts! While not yet
   at 100% coverage, `splinter.class.ts` is pretty well-tested. Run 
   `deno --allow-ffi test splinter.class_tests.ts` to see / use.
 - Additional documentation updates, tweaks and fixes
 - MRSW stress test harness now outputs progress (`--quiet` suppresses it)
 - MRSW stress test harness now creates unique store based on PID, and 
   garbage collects it (`--keep-test-store` preserves it).
 - Make create/open behavior across tools symmetrical 
 - Valgrind inclusion is off by default (so it's not a build dependency)
   You can still use Valgrind to run the tests; this just affects the tighter
   integration. Re-enable if you have `valgrind/valgrind.h (valgrind-devel)`.

v0.5.1 "Take Zero Dot Five One"
 - Maintenance / Cooling Release
 - New CHANGELOG
 - Dropped `splinter_logtee` from the build as `splinter_recv` now duplicates it.
 - Fixed dependency checks for `make install`
 - Updated documentation
 - Dropped Doxyfile (not needed, if someone else wants to maintain, it can be restored)
 - Updated TS Bindings & Splinter Class To Match Current Public C API
 - Created ffi_types.ts definition for TS bindings (for header / slot snapshots)
 - Dropped 'base protocol' definition since it was being mistaken for mandatory and not broadly   
   useful.

Sprints between minor versions usually last 1 - 3 weeks, depending.
